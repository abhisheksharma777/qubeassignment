To login with Admin you have to change the mobile number from the database so that the otp could be sent in it and after login you can use the interface and add users.
As you add the users with their mobile number they will have the rights to upload the doc by getting into the system via otp login.

It has very simple and userfriendly interface.

Thankyou..

As this is a project for Qube so none other can use this as their project except Qube,
